# Pros of TDD
There is an improved design of the system. The end result of writting tests before the code development concludes, has the effect of creating a clearer interface. Since, TDD focuses on testing one small feature at a time, the testing cycle becomes easier to understand and refactoring the application structure becomes easier to follow through.

# Cons of TDD
Since TDD focuses on testing small features one at a time, there can be too many tests written as developers over trivialize the complexity of each of their coded features. As a result, the testing can come to be redundant, taking more time and energy than that required. Moreover, if the testing itself is over simplified, then some more complex bugs maybe ignored.
